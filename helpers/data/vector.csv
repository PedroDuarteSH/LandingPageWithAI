My master thesis, "Augmenting Large Language Models with Context Retrieval," focuses on improving ethe efficiency and relevance of language models by integrating context-sensitive retrieval mechanisms. This ensures models generate more accurate and resource-efficient responses. This is based on a two-step model, where the first step selects relevant information and the second generated the expected output.
